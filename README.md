## 📜Contribution Guidelines

## 1. Branching Strategy
- **Main Branch (`main`)**: Always stable, production-ready code.
- **Testing Branch (`testing`)**: For integrating and validating features before merging into `main`.
- **Feature Branches (`feature/xyz`)**: Created for each new feature or bug fix.

## 2. Workflow Steps
1. **Create a Feature Branch**
   - Name: `feature/<short-description>`
   - Based on: `testing` branch

2. **Implement and Commit**
   - Follow clear commit messages: `type(scope): message`
     - Example: `feat(auth): add login functionality`

3. **Push to GitHub**
   - Push only the feature branch, not directly to `testing` or `main`.

4. **Create Pull Request (PR)**
   - Base branch: `testing`
   - Compare branch: your feature branch
   - Title: Short and descriptive
   - Description: Include purpose, changes made, and testing notes.
## 3. Code Review
- At least **one reviewer** must approve.
- Reviewers check:
  - Code quality
  - Functionality correctness
  - No breaking changes
## 4. Testing & Code Coverage
- Run tests locally before PR.
- CI pipeline should run:
  - Unit tests
  - Integration tests
  - Code coverage (minimum threshold: e.g., **80%**)
- Fail the PR if coverage drops below the set threshold.
## 5. Merging Rules
- **From `feature` → `testing`**: Allowed after approval and passing CI checks.
- **From `testing` → `main`**: Only after all features are validated and tested.
## 6. Post-Merge
- Delete merged feature branch.
- Update local branches with:
  ```bash
  git checkout testing
  git pull origin testing
  ```
